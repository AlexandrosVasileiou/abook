INSTALLATION

See INSTALL for detailed instructions.

If you want to use abook with mutt you should add following lines to your
~/.muttrc or to the systemwide /etc/Muttrc file.

set query_command="abook --mutt-query '%s'"
macro pager A |'abook --add-email'\n

After this you can make queries from mutt using the query command ('Q')
and add sender e-mail addresses to the addressbook from pager using 'A'
command. (Of course you can choose another keybinding if you like.)

NOTES

If your language specific characters don't work correctly make sure
that your locale configuration has been done properly. (On Linux you
must set at least LC_CTYPE environment variable)

If you want to import a ldif file generated by abook in Netscape you
must use the extension ``.4ld''.
