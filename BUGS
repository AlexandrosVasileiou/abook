known bugs in abook

* in X terminals keyboard may not behave as expected - this is propably
  a ncurses problem
* incompatible with some terminals
* --datafile option is a bit broken

* mutt / elm / pine export filters allows to create a file with dublicate
  aliases

* mutt alias import filter is quite poor. It only handles correctly aliases
  formatted like this: alias myalias Firstname Familyname <user@host.net>
