known bugs in abook

* in X terminals keyboard may not behave as expected - this is probably
  a ncurses problem
* incompatible with some terminals
  - there seems to be some problems with some gnome-terminal versions -
    gnome-terminal bug?

* mutt / elm / pine export filters allow to create a file with duplicate
  aliases

misc:
* Cursor disappears in some cases with abook_readline() on Solaris. If
  you have problems it is recommended to use ncurses library
