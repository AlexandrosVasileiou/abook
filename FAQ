abook FAQ
~~~~~~~~~

Q: Can I recall the old value in editor?

A: Yes, use up arrow to recall the old value.


Q: How to query all addresses when I press 'Q' in mutt?

A: Type "all" to the prompt.


Q: Can I mark multiple addresses in mutt after a query?

A: You can tag addresses with 't'. When ready, type ";m" (press first ';'
   and then 'm') and all tagged addresses will appear to your "To:"
   line.


Q: How to insert an address (or many) with abook when I'm forwarding
   a message in mutt? ("To:" and "Cc:" prompts)

A: When "To:" or "Cc:" prompt appears press ^t for query. (After query
   you can tag multiple addresses with 't')


Q: Can I add addresses to the abook addressbook from mutt?

A: Yes, it is possible starting from abook 0.4.15. See --add-email
   command line option and README.


Q: How can I import my abook entries to my PalmOS addressbook?

A: Export to palmcsv format, and import from there. Several GUI
   applications such as jpilot can do this, but the simplest way is to
   use pilot-addresses from the pilot-link package. Just export to
   addresses.palmcsv, then run this:
                                                                                
   pilot-addresses -d abook -c abook -r addresses.palmcsv
                                                                                
   This will delete everything in the abook category and replace it with
   the latest information from your abook database.  By keeping your
   abook entries in a separate category, you can continue to add and
   modify entries in other categories manually, and pilot-addresses will
   not change or delete them.
